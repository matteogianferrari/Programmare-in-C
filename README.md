# Programmare-in-C
My code solutions for the book "Programmare in C".

I did the exercises proposed by the book to test my knowledge in C programming language.

These solutions can be a useful resource for students of the "Ingegneria Informatica" degree who are attending the course of "Fondamenti di Informatica I e lab." (INF-1) at Unimore.

For the resolution of the exercises I tried as much as possible to use only the concepts explained up to the exercise in question (some exercises required knowledge of subsequent chapters for the resolution).

Personally I think that this book has not been structured in the correct way, some concepts should belong to the first chapters, while they are placed at the end.

P.S.
Complete Es10 Cap 6.
